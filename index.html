            <blockquote class="quote2">“It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.”</blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote2">“The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden.
                 A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject...
                 And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced.”</blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote2">“It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.”</blockquote>
